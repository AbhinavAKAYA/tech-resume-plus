### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbhinavAKAYA/tech-resume-plus.git
    cd tech-resume-plus
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    You can choose your preferred package manager (npm, Yarn, or Bun).

## 🎨 Customization

`tech-resume-plus` is built with customization in mind:

-   **Tailwind CSS:** All styling is managed through Tailwind CSS. You can modify `tailwind.config.ts` to extend themes, add custom utilities, or override default styles.
-   **Radix UI:** Components are built on Radix UI primitives, allowing for headless customization of component logic while maintaining full control over styling. You can wrap or extend existing Radix components to fit your specific design needs.
-   **`src/components/`:** This directory is where you'd typically find or add custom React components that build upon Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, allowing you to tailor existing elements or introduce new ones.
